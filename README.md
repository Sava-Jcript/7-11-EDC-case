Our group project named: "7/11" involves developing a user-friendly app using Next.js for the big real estate company EDC. The app aims to provide property sellers with an estimate of their property's value and information on potential buyers in the area, helping them make informed decisions about the selling process before working with a real estate agent. EDC can then help sellers contact potential buyers and guide them through the process.
